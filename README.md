**âœ¦ Intro**

Spots is a responsive image-sharing webpage that allows users to create, like, and delete photo cards, and update profile information. The layout mimics real-world social platforms, offering an intuitive and accessible interface across all device types â€” mobile, tablet, and desktop. This project is built from scratch using semantic HTML, modular CSS, and responsive design techniques.

**âœ¦ Figma**

The visual design of this project was provided via Figma, including detailed mockups for mobile (320px), tablet (~768px), and desktop (1440px). The layout and typography closely follow the Figma blueprint to ensure precision and design consistency.

**âœ¦ Images**

All assets, including avatars and photo cards, were exported directly from Figma. Images were optimized using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) before integration to improve performance and reduce load times.

> Fonts are loaded locally via `@font-face` in the `vendor/fonts.css` file. Only necessary font weights were included to stay within GitHub Pages file size limits.
